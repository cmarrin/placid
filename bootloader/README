Same as bootloader03, except it uses the config.txt file to load to
0x06000000 leaving much more room (than you would probably want to
use xmodem to load) for development.

Copy both kernel.img and config.txt to the sd card.  Remove or modify
config.txt when you change to some other kernel.img.  The main drawback
to this version is remembering to copy and then remove/replace both
files.
